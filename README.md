# Cataract-detection-Using-Tensorflow
This machine learning model, developed using TensorFlow, is designed to accurately detect cataracts from ocular images. By leveraging advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it analyzes input images to identify the presence of cataracts with high precision. The model has been trained on a curated dataset of labeled eye images.
